# Bird Tongues

The other day I was browsing the internet and stumbled upon some
extraordinary diagram that claimed woodpeckers had such long tongues
that at rest they sat atop their skull. Even as an admittedly novice
woodpecker anatomist, this seemed far-fetched, so off to Google I
went.

Quite surprisingly, not only was this trivia fact true, I learned
it was also true of hummingbirds! So weird!!
